/**
 * AutonomousAgentInterface
 *
 * Interface that agents must implement to support autonomous features including
 * local objective definition, peer evaluation, and collaborative feedback.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Enable agents to define and pursue domain-specific goals autonomously
 * - Support inter-agent evaluation for quality assurance
 * - Facilitate collaborative feedback and improvement
 * - Maintain system coherence through peer review
 *
 * Autonomous Agent Flow:
 * 1. Agent identifies opportunity → createLocalObjective()
 * 2. Objective approved → executeObjective()
 * 3. Output produced → Peer agents call evaluatePeerOutput()
 * 4. Feedback delivered → receiveFeedback()
 * 5. Agent learns and improves
 *
 * Requirements Validated:
 * - Requirement 1.1: Local objective creation
 * - Requirement 3.3: Peer output evaluation
 * - Requirement 5.4: Feedback acknowledgment
 * - Requirement 8.3: Collaboration capability
 *
 * @package ClicShopping\AI\InterfacesAI
 * @version 1.0.0

   * Example objectives:

   * - ValidationAgent: "Enhance validation coverage for SQL injection patterns"
